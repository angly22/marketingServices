          Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has
          to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content
          such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
          agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their
          competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and
          sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason.
          An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a
          deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to
          market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be
          like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
          difficult to do with a written description. However, written
          descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to
          be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any
          additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work
          with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters
          who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make
          your property attractive to potential buyers. .

        <h3 className="texto3">
          Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they
          purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search
          terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that
          way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real
          estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing.
          The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine
          optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using
          the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at
          Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms
          that match your home, your property will show up in the results and
          provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

          Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an
          agent doesn’t have a responsive, user-friendly website that is easy to
          navigate and provides an immersive experience for viewers who want to
          look at properties, they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents
          who work with Luxury Presence have websites that are designed and
          managed by seasoned professionals who know what property buyers want.
          Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD
          video capabilities, and lead capture strategies that help agents sell
          your home. Agents are further supported by analytics reporting, SEO
          optimization, third party integrations, and a reporting dashboard to
          help them easily utilize their site and maximize its potential. An
          agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who can easily reach
          a niche audience, streamline the selling process, and ensure your home
          gets the best promotion possible.
