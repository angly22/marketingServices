            If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or
            she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest
            in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate
            a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner
            with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in
            the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her
            time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social
            media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team
            utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and
            become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the
            power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to
            advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their
            competitors.
